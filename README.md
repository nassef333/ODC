and can find out  the  best  rated  places,  Each user can  evaluate the place and publish a video of the 
place  as  a  review  for  it,  and  each  reel has its own likes and comments, and users can follow other 
users  and  like  and  comment  for  them. On  the  home  page,  you  can  see  all the  reels on the site
